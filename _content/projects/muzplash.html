<p>
  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.muzplash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Muzplash</a> is a plugin for
  <a href="http://get.muzei.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Muzei</a> providing images from 
  <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unsplash</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Some of the features of Muzplash are:
  <ul>
    <li>Implements the new Muzei 3 API.</li>
    <li>Choose the theme of the images to provide. Landscapes, cityscapes, cars or cats, whatever you choose to get.</li>
    <li>Filter out non-geolocated images. Because sometimes it is frustrating to miss the location of that beautiful landscape.</li>
    <li>Get the author, description and location of the image in Muzei, and access the full details in Unsplash in just one click.</li>
    <li>Open the image location in Google Maps within Muzei.</li>
    <li>Choose how many images to load everytime Muzei asks for new pictures. Thus, even if you temporarily don't have internet access, Muzei will probably have a set of unseen images in cache.</li>
    <li>The authors are attributed and their download statistics are incremented.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  As of September 2021, Muzplash has been installed more than 10 000 times, and has around 3 000 active users.

  This is not the only Android application I've made, but probably the only one worth mentioning. It was my first experience with Kotlin however.
