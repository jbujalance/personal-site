  All the new rising technologies around blockchains, cryptocurrencies, decentralized applications, etc. have attracted my attention during the last year.
  After having experimented a little with some of these tools and technologies, such as decentralized exchanges and wallets, I got intereseted on the
  technical and development side of it. I started reading technical articles and documentations on the inner workings of the multiple blockchain networks,
  and I decided to spin up an Ethereum development environment on my machine and try out some of these things.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/jbujalance/cryptotetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cryptotetes</a> is a very simple and dummy ERC20 token
  deployable on networks such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain. I made it in order to learn how these decentralized networks work and how to create on them.
  Cryptotetes is <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/token/0x2C86704E6F49e422C83502529b81eFD69DB26e85" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deployed</a>
  on the Ethereum's testnet 'Ropsten'. It is useless and valueless, but it is engraved in the Ropsten blockchain for perpetuity.
</p>

<p>
  This little project let me learn the fundamentals of Ethereum, Solidity, and framworks like Truffle, OpenZeppelin or Web3. I may rewrite the whole
  thing using Hardhat, Waffle and Ethers.js instead of Truffle and Web3.js.
</p>

<p>
  I don't know if blockchain technologies are just a passing fad or are here to stay, but they are surely interesting on a technical point of view.
