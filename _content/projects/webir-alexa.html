<p>
  WebIR Alexa is an Amazon Alexa skill that connects to a <a href="/projects/webir">WebIR</a> server so that it can control any managed IR device.
  I use it every day to control my kitchen TV, which is a small, old, not-smart-at-all TV. It is much more convenient to ask Alexa to turn on the TV
  or change the channel while cooking, instead of having to stop whatever you are doing, clean your hands, and grab the remote.

<p>
  The skill mainly uses the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smarthome/build-smart-home-skills-for-entertainment-devices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Device Skills API</a>,
  so I didn't need to train a custom voice command model. It is hosted on an AWS Lambda function, and deployed automatically on every push to master
  using the Github Actions.
