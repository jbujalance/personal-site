<p>
  My personal website, which I use to showcase some of the personal projects I have worked on. I am not a great front-end developper, and I must admit
  I kind of hate CSS, so I didn't try to make anything complex: no fancy animations, no crazy effects, no dark mode theme, etc.
  The idea was to make something simple and performant.
</p>

<p>
  The website is statically generated using NextJS. This allows the generated HTML to be cached in a CDN in order to reduce the response times,
  as well as improve the SEO. It is deployed on <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vercel</a>,
  which works really well with NextJS applications.
</p>

<p>
  As I said, I am not good with CSS, so I used <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulma</a> to style the site.
  It is probably not the most advanced or flexible CSS framework, but it helps to keep things simple and yet visually pleasing, and it is lighter
  than other popular CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.
